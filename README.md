Detection of facial expression using 3 techniques 

Facial expressions are one of the most important behavioral
measures for emotion recognition. Expressions can tell a lot
about the person, his behavior, what he is thinking and this
data is vital in making various predictions which can have a
variety of applications. In this paper we have implemented
and compared three types of facial expression recognition and
classification techniques. The first one is a state-of-the-art
convolutional neural network, the second one is a transfer
learning approach using the InceptionV3 model and in the last
one, we have extracted the 68 facial points which have been
identified as important for recognizing the expression of a
person and passed it to a deep neural network. All these
techniques have given accuracies over 90%, so comes the
need to compare them in detail and determine which one of
them would give results more accurately and efficiently.
